EECS4413-Z - Building E-Commerce Systems (2020-2021) | York University

This is course was about the study of the technical infrastructure that underlies Electronic Commerce on the Internet. The foundational concepts are presented through a series of projects that use an industrial-strength framework on the server side, standard-compliant technologies on the client side, and a variety of messaging protocols on the network side.

In this repository you will find the lab manuals along with the solutions I have coded.
